## Algorithm

1. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.

2. The steps also need to be distinct.

3. The algorithm should produce a result.

4. The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

## Big O

### Runtimes

- Constant
- Linear
- Logarithmic => Binary Search O(log n) / Constant Space
- Quadratic
