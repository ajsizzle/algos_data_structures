# Study notes from Intro to Algorithms // FCC

## Algorithm

1. The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order.

2. The steps also need to be distinct.

3. The algorithm should produce a result.

4. The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

## Big O

### Runtimes

- Constant
- Linear
- Logarithmic => Binary Search O(log n) / Constant Space
- Quadratic

## Data Structures

- Data Structure = a data storage format. It is a collection of values and the format
  they are stored in, the relationship between the values in the collection as well as
  the operations applied on the stored data in the structure.

- Can be homogeneous or heterogeneous

### Operations on Data Structures

1. Access and read values

2. Search for arbitrary values

3. Insert values at any point into the structure

4. Delete values in the structure

#### Space = (N \* M)

    - whereas N is the index and M is the size of the stored data
